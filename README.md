## Getting Started

-   Click `Use This Template` and select `Create a new repository`
-   Clone your newly created repository
-   Feel free to delete the `.idea/` or `.vscode/` config directories if you don't use WebStorm or VSCode
-   Open up `package.json` and review or edit its contents
-   In the root of the repository, execute `npm i`
-   Now execute `npm run dev` to run the app

### DevTools

Get the [React Developer Tools](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/react-developer-tools) extension for your browser.

## Deployment

I recommend that you deploy your app (static site) to [Render](https://render.com/).
